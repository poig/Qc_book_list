### üßê [General background to proceed intermediate and advanced level](http://www.mit.edu/~aram/advice/quantum.html) ([click me for more comprehensive guide](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/mini_lib.html)):
Quantum computing (theory) is at the intersection of math, physics, and computer science. (Experiment also can involve electrical engineering.) Eventually, you will want to learn aspects of all of these fields, but when starting you can use any for an entry into the field. Within each field, the subjects you will want to know are:
- Physics: First learn quantum mechanics. At more advanced levels, various aspects of quantum information overlap with AMO, condensed matter, and high energy.  
- Math: First linear algebra and probability. Later my preferences would be to learn some group and representation theory, random matrix theory, and functional analysis, but eventually, most fields of math overlap with quantum information, and other researchers may emphasize different areas of math.  
- Computer Science: Most theory topics are relevant although are less crucial at first: i.e. algorithms, cryptography, information theory, error-correcting codes, optimization, complexity, and machine learning. If you haven't had any CS theory exposure, undergrad algorithms are a good place to start because they will show you CS-theory ways of thinking, including ideas like the asymptotic analysis.
